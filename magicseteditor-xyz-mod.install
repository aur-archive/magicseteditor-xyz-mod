The fonts required for this package can't be put on the AUR due to licensing issues.
In order to get them, download the binary release here:
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/magicseteditor/mse-linux32-2011-02-05-full.tar.gz
Copy the fonts into your /usr/share/fonts/TTF folder or wrap them up
with some fancy PKGBUILD of your own.

Happy editing!
